        <h2 id="txt"><P>TXT is an acronym for Tomorrow X Together.[3] In Korean, the group's name is 투모로우바이투게더 ,[4] read as "Tomorrow by Together" and transliterated into Hangul; they do not have a separate Korean version of their name.[5] According to their website, their name refers to five individuals who "come together under one dream in hopes of building a better tomorrow".[6]

            In their first interview with MBC's Section TV, the group stated that they prefer to be called "Tomorrow X Together" over "TXT".[7] 
            They debuted on March 4, 2019, with the extended play (EP) The Dream Chapter: Star. The EP debuted and peaked at number one on the Gaon Album Chart and Billboard World Albums Chart and entered the US Billboard 200 at number 140, the highest-charting debut album by any male K-pop group at the time. Its lead single "Crown" debuted at number one on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. The group also topped the Billboard Emerging Artists chart. TXT was the first Korean boygroup to perform and headline at Lollapalooza, one of the biggest music festivals in the US. </P> </h2>
