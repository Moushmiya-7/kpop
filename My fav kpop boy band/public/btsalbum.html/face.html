            <h2 id="face"><p>Face is the debut studio album[A] by South Korean singer Jimin of BTS. Released on March 24, 2023, through Big Hit Music, it is primarily a pop, hip hop, and R&B record, with Pdogg, Ghstloop, and Evan responsible for production. Comprising five songs, all co-written by Jimin, and one instrumental, the album was heavily inspired by the emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Jimin as a person and performer and addresses "themes of loneliness, wrestling with oneself, and finding freedom".[4] Two singles were released in support of Face: the lead single "Set Me Free Pt. 2" and the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single "Like Crazy".
Domestically, Face broke sales records on its opening day, selling over 1 million copies, and in its first week, surpassing 1.45 million sales, making Jimin the first solo artist in Hanteo Chart history to do so; the album subsequently debuted at number one on the Circle Album Chart. It topped the Oricon Albums and Digital Albums charts, and Billboard Japan's Hot Albums chart in Japan. Jimin is the first solo artist to debut at number one on both Oricon album charts in 2023. Face debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, becoming the highest-charting album by a South Korean solo artist in Billboard chart history. It also reached the top ten in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Lithuania, Switzerland and New Zealand. </p></li></h2>
