            <h2 id="TA"><p>"The Astronaut" is a song by South Korean singer Jin of BTS released on October 28, 2022, as his debut solo single. The song was co-written by: Jin; British rock band Coldplay, who previously collaborated with BTS on "My Universe"; Norwegian DJ Kygo, who produced the track with Bill Rahko; and Chris Martin's son Moses Martin. The song is about Jin's affection for and relationship with his fans. It explores themes of connection and love through the use of a recurring cosmic motif favored by both the band and singer, as evidenced in other songs they have written.
Described as "a gift to fans", it was released ahead of Jin's enlistment, which occurred shortly afterwards. The single is available digitally and in CD format. An accompanying music video portrays the singer as an alien astronaut who accidentally crash-lands on Earth and must eventually choose between staying with his found family or returning to his home planet. </p></li></h2>
